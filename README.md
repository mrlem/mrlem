## Hi, I'm Seb 👋

I'm a french developer:
* 💼 currently working in Android development
* 🔎 mainly focused on Kotlin (android, multiplatform, server-side)
* 🐧 using Linux on a daily basis
* 🎮 with a keen interest for game development
* 🌿 trying to build sustainable software, as part of a broader life-approach

Most of my repositories are playgrounds that I used at one moment or anothe, out of curiosity. Feel free to browse 😀
