## Hi, I'm Seb 👋

I'm a french developer:
* 💼 currently working in **Android development**
* 🔎 mainly focused on **Kotlin** (android, multiplatform, ktor, spring-boot)
* 🐧 using **Linux** on a daily basis
* 🎮 with a keen interest for **game development**
* 🌿 trying to build **sustainable** software, as part of a broader life-approach

Most of my repositories are playgrounds that I used at one moment or another, out of curiosity. Feel free to browse 😀
